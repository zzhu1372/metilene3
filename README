# **metilene<sup>3**: Identifying DMRs Across Multiple Conditions with Auto-Classification

metilene<sup>3</sup> is a computational tool to identify Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) across multiple groups (supervised) or samples (unsupervised). With the identified DMRs, metilene<sup>3</sup> enables inference of epigenetic relationships by constructing a Differentially Methylated Tree (DMTree), which can also be used for sample clustering.

Please see the [metilene<sup>3</sup>-doc](https://zzhu1372.github.io/metilene3-doc) for more details.
